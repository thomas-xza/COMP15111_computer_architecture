;;; ;;;  "Don't optimise until you've measured"
;;; ;;; 	- David Patterson, Computer Organization (RISC-V), 6th edition


;;; ;;;  "Don't optimise unless it reduces time spent debugging with Bennett" - me
	

;;; ;;;   LOG OF WORKING CHANGES:
;;; ;;;   - hardcoded start of _stack address to 0x1000, to find it with Bennett's GUI
;;; ;;;   - can always be replaced with dynamic stack without issues (e.g. at end of exercise)


_stack		equ	0x1000
	
	MOV 	SP, #_stack		; set SP to point to hardcoded location of _stack
	
; COMP15111 lab 4 - Template file

print_char	equ	0		; Define names to aid readability
stop		equ	2
print_str	equ	3
print_no	equ	4

cLF		equ	10		; Line-feed character

	
	;; ADR	SP, _stack	; set SP pointing to the end of our stack
	
	B	main


;;; ;;;   Exactly what memory address does this actually go to??? 100 bytes/words from end?
;;; ;;;     Explicit address to set stack to is better for debugging.

;;; ;;;   Boosted size of stack to write Assembly faster.

;;; ;;;   - Wonder what the real-life cost of this would be?
;;; ;;;		Negligible?
