Q1) After executing the "LDR R0" instruction, the value of PC is (?) and of R0
is (?)

Q2) After executing the "LDR R1" instruction, the value of PC is (?) and of R1
is (?)

Q3) After executing the "LDR R2" instruction, the value of PC is (?) and of R2
is (?)


(For Q4 and Q5, we are asking about the registers involved in the arithmetic,
not PC/R15)

Q4) The first time the "MUL" instruction is executed, the value of register (?)
changes from (?) to (?)

Q5) The first time the "SUB" instruction is executed, the value of register (?)
changes from (?) to (?)


(For Q6, Q7, and Q8, we are asking about the effect of running the program
from the beginning until it stops at the SVC instruction, not about the
effect of just one instruction)

Q6) the "BEQ" instruction (in the loop) is executed (?) times but only performs the branch (?)
times

Q7) register (?) counts down from (?) to (?)

Q8) which arithemtic operation does the program implement? (write down the equation)


Q9) Optimize the two branch instructions - within the loop - by replacing them with one instruction. 
You must maintain the same functionality of the whole program. Write down the new instruction.
